# Projects
* The Baby Heart System Project is theoretical where I worked on introducing a new system where we can develop a software that can be integrated in an apple watch to hear the audio of a fetus as well as a video of their heart beat as well. 
* I learned the Agile Methodolgy, SDLC, and design patterns as well.
* To view the result of the C++ projects such as 8 numbers in a cross, missionaries and cannibals, stable marriage, and towers of Hanoi,simply copy/paste the code in a C++ online compiler.
